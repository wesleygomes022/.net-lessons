# Considerations about Ref and Out
* Diferences: 
    - The variable passed as parameter REF MUST be initiated.
    - The variable passed as parameter OUT don't need to be initiated.

* Conclusion: both are the same, but ref is a way to make the compiler force the user to initiate the variable.

* Note: both are considered "code smells" and must be avoid.
